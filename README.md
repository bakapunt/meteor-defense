# Meteor Defense
An HTML5 canvas game with falling meteors for the CS25210 Client Side Graphics Programming For the Web assignment.

## The assignment
- This assignment involved programming a game using JavaScript and the `<canvas>` element.
- The game must have "gravity", meaning at least one game object must accelerate towards one edge of the canvas.
- The game must be incorporated into a small website created in HTML5 and styled in CSS3.
- The game requires mouse interaction, and should have good playability, graphics, alternate controls, sounds, and should keep a high score.

## The game
The game I created is much like a "catcher" type game, with a retro space/sci-fi theme.
It can be played at http://users.aber.ac.uk/pus1/ftw/meteor-defense/.
